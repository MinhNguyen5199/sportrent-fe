# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Site
https://sportsrentfrontend.herokuapp.com/
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

6. Cancellation and Refunds: Allow employees to process reservation cancellations and initiate refunds if necessary. The system should handle any refund calculations and update the customer's payment status accordingly.

7. Reservation Notes: Provide a section for employees to add internal notes or comments related to reservations. This allows employees to communicate important information or specific instructions to other team members involved in the rental process.

8. Check-in and Check-out: Enable employees to mark when a customer checks in to pick up the rental item and when the customer returns it. This helps track the rental duration accurately and ensures timely returns.

9. Overdue Reservations: Highlight and notify employees about reservations that are overdue or approaching their return dates. This prompts them to follow up with customers and take appropriate actions, such as contacting customers for extensions or enforcing late fees.

10. Reservation History: Maintain a complete history of all past reservations, including details such as rental dates, rental items, customer information, and any notes or modifications made. This allows employees to quickly reference previous interactions and better serve returning customers.
