## Description
The leader of my team(a team of 3 people) worked for several months at Sport Rent and he knew that this local business needed an e-commerce website. In this project, I worked on front-end (sometimes, I had to work on back-end), the other guy worked on back-end, the leader gathered all necessary information and requirements for the project. Additionally,  he provided direction and guidance to the team throughout the development process, ensuring that the final product aligned with the company's goals and objectives. However, the leader dropped this project and me and the other guy had to continue with this project.
